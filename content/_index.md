## 🪴 garden

welcome to my internet garden, a cozy corner of the internet for storing my ideas and sharing what i'm working on.

in my garden you can find my [blog posts](@/blog/_index.md) and documention for some of my [tools](@/tools/_index.md).

✨ i'm passionate about:

- software (neovim, nix, rust, and more)
- aesthetics (colorschemes, ui design, minimalism)
- nature & mythology (gardens, forests, folklore)

🌱 in my projects, i blend these passions together:

- evergarden (a soft, nature-inspired colorscheme)
- ember (a lightweight neovim plugin manager) (work-in-progress)
- ivy (a nix-based neovim setup)
- ...and more.
