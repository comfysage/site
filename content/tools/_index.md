# 🔧 tools

this is where i keep the tools i've built — small creations designed to make
development smoother, workflows simpler, and ideas easier to bring to life.

## 🛠️ my tools

- **evergarden** – a soft, nature-inspired colorscheme
- **ivy** – a nix-based neovim setup
- **ember** – a lightweight neovim plugin manager *(work-in-progress)*
- **mossy.nvim** – a development plugin for neovim, which currently supports
  formatting but will soon also support linting

more tools are always growing here — check back later! 🌿
